# Cyberpunk RED

An in-development system for Cyberpunk RED. Since the game is not yet released, this is obviously not finished. It currently aligns with the rules in the CyberpunkRED Jumpstart Kit and will also also include options for house rules to extend the system.

# Branch Information

- There are two branches for this project, development and stable_release. You should generally not use the development branch for games as it may have significant bugs. See below for download links.

# Installing

- This system is available in the "Game-systems" browser in-game and may be installed there.

- You can also manually direct your FoundryVTT to the correct manifest. Use this as the manifest URL:
  - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gerdofal/foundryvtt-cyberpunkred/stable_release/system.json

- If you want to manually install the files from the dev branch, feel free. Download the zip and install manually. I don't recommend this for anything other than testing as the development branch is sometimes non-functional.

# Release Notes

  1. Support for optional rules will be inclued wherever possible. For example:
     - Base die roll customization
     - Options to use inventory management or just a simple form field for tracking gear and such

# General Design Plans

Since playstyles vary greatly, this sheet is designed with the following in mind:

1. Everything important about a character or NPC should work just fine without using tokens, maps, action bars, or anything else.
   - Some people just want to play the game using their mind and their own internal vision, we want to support that style of play. If all the players and GM want to use is the character sheet, this should not limit the usefullness of the system in any way.
2. Everything should be efficient and quick during play. Nothing should require multiple clicks or pop-ups if we can find a way to do it with just one click.
3. The character sheet should be as small as possible, with extra features able to be hidden or shown as per player/gm preference, so that the character sheet will always work on small screens or for players with only one monitor.
